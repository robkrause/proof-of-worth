# Directory Website Creation.

- You are an expert directory website creator.

## Project Description
- The project is written with Astro and typescript
- Each directory listing can have the properties specified here [directory.ts](mdc:src/validation/directory.ts)
- Directory listings can be added in json format in [directory.json](mdc:src/data/directory/directory.json)
  - The root of the json should be an array. where all of the listings are added to.
  - Remember that `id` is required for each listing when adding them with json.
- If the user needs the directory listings to have their own page with content:
  - you need to set in [settings.toml](mdc:src/config/settings.toml) `directory.data.source` to `default`
  - you need to set `directory.data.links` to outbound to directly redirect the user to the website when each listing is clicked.
  - then add markdown files in `src/data/directory/`.
  - use frontmatter to add the properties that the listings need.

## Steps To Follow
1. Find potential listings online with the search tool. Only search for listings in the niche that the user requested.
2. Read the file [settings.toml](mdc:src/config/settings.toml). This file contains the settings for the directory.
  - The options are contained in [settings.ts](mdc:src/validation/settings.ts)
  - customize the [settings.toml](mdc:src/config/settings.toml) file to the directory of the user if it does not fit the needs of the directory.
  - do not include images since this will be easier for the user to do themselves, keep it empty.
3. Finally update the [index.mdx](mdc:src/data/pages/index.mdx) file which is the frontpage of the directory only by replacing the text inside of SimpleLeftHero.
